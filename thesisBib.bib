Given their strict operating requirements, such systems are automated and controlled in real time by several digital controllers receiving measurements from sensors and transmitting control signals to actuators. Since these physical systems are often spatially distributed, there is a need for information technology (IT) infrastructures enabling the timely data flow between the system components. These networked control systems are ubiquitous in modern societies [1]. Examples include the electric power network, intelligent transport systems, and industrial processes.},

abstract={Cyberphysical systems integrate physical processes, computational resources, and communication capabilities. Cyberphysical systems have permeated modern society, becoming prevalent in many domains, including energy production, health care, and telecommunications. Examples of cyberphysical systems include sensor networks, industrial automation systems, and critical infrastructures such as transportation networks, power generation and distribution networks, water and gas distribution networks, and advanced manufacturing systems. The integration of cybertechnologies with physical processes increases system efficiencies and, at the same time, introduces vulnerabilities that undermine the reliability of critical infrastructures. As recently highlighted by the Maroochy water breach in March 2000 [1], multiple recent power blackouts in Brazil [2], the SQL Slammer worm attack on the Davis-Besse nuclear plant in January 2003 [3], the StuxNet computer worm in June 2010 [4], and various industrial security incidents [5], cyberphysical systems are prone to failures and attacks on their physical infrastructure and cyberattacks on their data management and communication layer [6], [7].}

	abstract = {This article considers a two-player strategic game for network routing under link disruptions. Player 1 (defender) routes flow through a network to maximize her value of effective flow while facing transportation costs. Player 2 (attacker) simultaneously disrupts one or more links to maximize her value of lost flow but also faces cost of disrupting links. Linear programming duality in zero-sum games and the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem are applied to obtain properties that are satisfied in any Nash equilibrium. A characterization of the support of the equilibrium strategies is provided using graph-theoretic arguments. Finally, conditions under which these results extend to budget-constrained environments are also studied. These results extend the classical minimum cost maximum flow problem and the minimum cut problem to a class of security games on flow networks.},

	volume = {72},
	abstract = {This paper focuses on the optimal sensor placement problem for the identification of pipe failure locations in large-scale urban water systems. The problem involves selecting the minimum number of sensors such that every pipe failure can be uniquely localized. This problem can be viewed as a minimum test cover (MTC) problem, which is NP-hard. We consider two approaches to obtain approximate solutions to this problem. In the first approach, we transform the MTC problem to a minimum set cover (MSC) problem and use the greedy algorithm that exploits the submodularity property of the MSC problem to compute the solution to the MTC problem. In the second approach, we develop a new augmented greedy algorithm for solving the MTC problem. This approach does not require the transformation of the MTC to MSC. Our augmented greedy algorithm provides in a significant computational improvement while guaranteeing the same approximation ratio as the first approach. We propose several metrics to evaluate the performance of the sensor placement designs. Finally, we present detailed computational experiments for a number of real water distribution networks.},

Resilience is demonstrated in that the controller maintains collective stability in the event of communication or subsystem failures, with a degradation of performance.

	title = {Resilient control system execution agent ({ReCoSEA})},
	doi = {10.1109/ISRCS.2012.6309308},
	abstract = {In an increasingly connected world, critical infrastructure systems suffer from two types of vulnerability. The first is the traditionally recognized problem of monitoring the systems for faults and failures, recognizing and analyzing data, and responding with real understanding to the problems of the system. Increasingly complex systems create the opportunity for single points of failure to cascade when inaccurate assessment of system health increases response time or leads to faulty analysis of the problems involved. A second problem involves vulnerability to cyber intrusion, in which malignant actors can mask system degradation or present false data about system status. A resilient system will protect stability, efficiency, and security. To ensure these three states, the system must react to changing conditions within the system with coordination: no one component of the system can be allowed to react to problems without real consideration of the effects of that action on other components within the system. Systems with multi-agent design typically have three layers of action, a management layer, a coordination layer, and an execution layer. A resilient multi-agent system will emphasize functions of the execution layer, which has the responsibility of initiating actions, monitoring, analyzing, and controlling its own processes, while feeding information back to the higher levels of management and coordination. The design concept of a resilient control system execution agent (ReCoSEA) grows out of these underpinnings, and through the use of computational intelligence techniques, this paper suggests an associated design methodology.},

A reputation-based resilient distributed control algorithm is first proposed for the leader-follower consensus network. The proposed algorithm embeds a resilience mechanism that includes four phases (detection, mitigation, identification, and update), into the control process in a distributed manner. At each phase, every agent only uses local and one-hop neighbors' information to identify and isolate the misbehaving agents, and even compensate their effect on the system. We then extend the proposed algorithm to the leaderless consensus network by introducing and adding two recovery schemes (rollback and excitation recovery) into the current framework to guarantee the accurate convergence of the well-behaving agents in NCS. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through case studies in multirobot formation control and wireless sensor networks.},

Therefore, in this paper, we study the problem of distributed fault detection and isolation (FDI) in large networked systems with uncertain system models. The linear networked system is composed of interconnected subsystems and may be represented as a graph. The subsystems are represented by nodes, while the edges correspond to the interconnections between subsystems. Considering faults that may occur on the interconnections and subsystems, as our first contribution, we propose a distributed scheme to jointly detect and isolate faults occurring in nodes and edges of the system. As our second contribution, we analyze the behavior of the proposed scheme under model uncertainties caused by the addition or removal of edges. Additionally, we propose a novel distributed FDI scheme based on local models and measurements that is resilient to changes outside of the local subsystem and achieves FDI. Our third contribution addresses the complexity reduction of the distributed FDI method, by characterizing the minimum amount of model information and measurements needed to achieve FDI and by reducing the number of monitoring nodes. The proposed methods can be fused to design a scalable and resilient distributed FDI architecture that achieves local FDI despite unknown changes outside the local subsystem. The proposed approach is illustrated by numerical experiments on the IEEE 118-bus power network benchmark.},

Our scheme assumes a broadcast model of communication (where all nodes transmit the same value to all of their neighbors) and utilizes a linear iteration where, at each time-step, each node updates its value to be a weighted average of its own previous value and those of its neighbors. We consider a node to be malicious or faulty if, instead of following the predefined linear strategy, it updates its value arbitrarily at each time-step (perhaps conspiring with other malicious nodes in the process). We show that the topology of the network completely characterizes the resilience of linear iterative strategies to this kind of malicious behavior. First, when the network contains 2f or fewer vertex-disjoint paths from some node xj to another node xi , we provide an explicit strategy for f malicious nodes to follow in order to prevent node xi from receiving any information about xj's value. Next, if node xi has at least 2f+1 vertex-disjoint paths from every other (non-neighboring) node, we show that xi is guaranteed to be able to calculate any arbitrary function of all node values when the number of malicious nodes is f or less. Furthermore, we show that this function can be calculated after running the linear iteration for a finite number of time-steps (upper bounded by the number of nodes in the network) with almost any set of weights (i.e., for all weights except for a set of measure zero).},

In this paper, we consider malicious cyber attacks in a remote state estimation application where a smart sensor node transmits data to a remote estimator equipped with a false data detector. It is assumed that all the sensor data can be observed and modified by the malicious attacker and a residue-based detection algorithm is used at the remote side to detect data anomalies. We propose a linear deception attack strategy and present the corresponding feasibility constraint which guarantees that the attacker is able to successfully inject false data without being detected. The evolution of the estimation error covariance at the remote estimator is derived and the degradation of system performance under the proposed linear attack policy is analyzed. Furthermore, we obtain a closed-form expression of the optimal attack strategy among all linear attacks. Comparison of attack strategies through simulated examples are provided to illustrate the theoretical results.},

For each network state, different network configurations can be used, which govern the network topology and routing of packets. The problem addressed is to determine the optimal network configuration to use in each network state, in order to minimize an expected error covariance measure. Computation of the expected error covariance cost function has a complexity of O(2MΔmax), where M is the number of sensors and Δmax is the maximum time between transitions of the semi- Markov chain. A sub-optimal method which minimizes the upper bound of the expected error covariance, that can be computed with a reduced complexity of O(2M), is proposed, which in many cases gives identical results to the optimal method. Conditions for estimator stability under both the optimal and suboptimal reconfiguration methods are derived using stochastic Lyapunov functions.

The proposed robust zero-dynamics attack needs a nominal model of the system and, in addition, utilizes the input and output signals of the system. The proposed attack illustrates how the adversary is able to use disclosure resources instead of exact model knowledge.

In particular, the threat scenarios tackled in the paper consider adversaries that aim at deteriorating the system's performance by maximizing the corresponding quadratic cost function, while remaining stealthy with respect to anomaly detectors. As opposed to other work in the literature, the effect of the adversary's actions on the anomaly detector's output is not constrained to be zero at all times. Moreover, scenarios where the adversary has uncertain model knowledge are also addressed. The set of strategic attack policies is formulated as a non-convex constrained optimization problem, leading to a sensitivity metric denoted as the output-to-output ℓ2-gain. Using the framework of dissipative systems, the output-to-output gain is computed through an equivalent convex optimization problem. Additionally, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the output-to-output gain to be unbounded, with and without model uncertainties, which are tightly related to the invariant zeros of the system.},

Multiple sensors make observations of a process, which are then transmitted, possibly via intermediate sensors, to a central gateway. Transmission over each link can experience packet drops. The time-varying wireless network environment is modelled by the notion of a network state as in Quevedo et al. (2013a). For each network state, different network configurations can be used, which govern the network topology and routing of packets. Switching between different configurations incurs a cost, in that unwanted links will need to be removed before the establishment of new links, leading to a transient time in which some links may not be available. The problem is to determine the optimal network configurations to use in each network state, in order to minimize an expected error covariance measure that takes into account the cost of reconfiguration. A simpler sub-optimal method which minimizes the upper bound of the expected error is also proposed, which in numerical simulations gives essentially identical results to the optimal method.},

Current \{EMS\} state estimation algorithms have bad data detection (BDD) schemes to detect outliers in the measurement data, based on high measurement redundancy. Although these methods can detect a set of basic cyber attacks, they may fail in the presence of an intelligent attacker. We explore the latter by considering scenarios where stealthy deception attacks are performed by sending false information to the control center. We begin by presenting a recent framework that characterizes the attack as an optimization problem with the objective specified through a security metric and constraints corresponding to the attack cost. The framework is used to conduct realistic experiments on a state-of-the-art \{SCADA\} \{EMS\} software for a power network example with 14 substations, 27 buses, and 40 branches. To the authors best knowledge, this is the first such experimental study. The results indicate how state estimators for power networks can be made more resilient to cyber security attacks.},

The goal of the adversary, who uses the combined attack, is to perturb the state estimates while remaining hidden from the observer. We propose security metrics that quantify vulnerability of power grids to combined data attacks under single and multi-path routing communication models. In order to evaluate the proposed security metrics, we formulate them as mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems. The relation between the security metrics of combined data attacks and pure data integrity attacks is analyzed, based on which we show that, when data availability and data integrity attacks have the same cost, the two metrics coincide. When data availability attacks have a lower cost than data integrity attacks, we show that a combined data attack could be executed with less attack resources compared to pure data integrity attacks. Furthermore, it is shown that combined data attacks would bypass integrity-focused mitigation schemes. These conclusions are supported by the results obtained on a power system model with and without a communication model with single or multi-path routing.},

The analysis is performed under a variety of assumptions of adversary capability regarding knowledge of details of the VVC algorithm used, system topology, access to actual measurements, and ability to corrupt measurements. The adversary also faces an optimization problem, which is to maximize adverse impact while remaining stealthy. This is achieved by first identifying sets of measurements that can be jointly but stealthily corrupted. Then, the maximal impact of such data corruption is computed for the case where the operator is unaware of the attack and directly applies the configuration from the integrated VVC. Furthermore, since the attacker is constrained to remaining stealthy, we consider a game-theoretic framework where the operator chooses settings to maximize observability and constrain the adversary action space.},

The objective of the attacker is to maximize the estimation error of the Kalman filter - which in turn quantifies the degradation of the control performance - by tampering with the control input, while remaining undetected. We introduce a notion of ε-stealthiness to quantify the difficulty to detect an attack when an arbitrary detection algorithm is implemented by the controller. For a desired value of ε-stealthiness, we quantify the largest estimation error that an attacker can induce, and we analytically characterize an optimal attack strategy. Because our bounds are independent of the detection mechanism implemented by the controller, our information-theoretic analysis characterizes fundamental security limitations of stochastic cyber-physical systems.},

A solution to this problem is relevant for several tasks in multi-agent systems including motion coordination, clock synchronization, and cooperative estimation. In a linear consensus network, we allow for the presence of misbehaving agents, whose behavior deviate from the nominal consensus evolution. We model misbehaviors as unknown and unmeasurable inputs affecting the network, and we cast the misbehavior detection and identification problem into an unknown-input system theoretic framework. We consider two extreme cases of misbehaving agents, namely faulty (non-colluding) and malicious (Byzantine) agents. First, we characterize the set of inputs that allow misbehaving agents to affect the consensus network while remaining undetected and/or unidentified from certain observing agents. Second, we provide worst-case bounds for the number of concurrent faulty or malicious agents that can be detected and identified. Precisely, the consensus network needs to be 2k+1 (resp. k+1) connected for k malicious (resp. faulty) agents to be generially detectable and identifiable by every well behaving agent. Third, we quantify the effect of undetectable inputs on the final consensus value. Fourth, we design three algorithms to detect and identify misbehaving agents. The first and the second algorithm apply fault detection techniques, and affords complete detection and identification if global knowledge of the network is available to each agent, at a high computational cost. The third algorithm is designed to exploit the presence in the network of weakly interconnected subparts, and provides local detection and identification of misbehaving agents whose behavior deviates more than a threshold, which is quantified in terms of the interconnection structure.},

	title = {Time-{Varying} {Actuator} {Scheduling} in {Complex} {Networks}},
	abstract = {This paper studies the benefit of time-varying actuator scheduling on the controllability of undirected complex networks with linear dynamics. We define a new notion of nodal communicability, termed 2k-communicability, and unveil the role that this centrality measure plays in selecting which nodes to actuate over time to optimize network controllability, as measured by the trace of the controllability Gramian. We identify various conditions on the network structure that determine whether it benefits or not from time-varying actuator scheduling, and quantify the sub-optimality gap of time-invariant policies. Intuitively, our analysis shows that time-varying actuator policies should be used when the network has multiple heterogeneous central nodes, as measured by 2k-communicability. We illustrate our results with examples of deterministic and random networks. I. INTRODUCTION Many natural and man-made systems, ranging from the nervous system to power and transportation grids and the Internet, exhibit dynamic behaviors that evolve over a sparse and complex interconnection structure. The ability to control network dynamics is not only a theoretically challenging problem but, more importantly, a barrier to fundamental breakthroughs across engineering, social sciences, and neuroscience. While multiple studies have addressed various aspects of this problem, several fundamental questions remain unanswered, including to what extent the capability of actuating a different set of nodes over time can improve controllability of large-scale, time-varying network systems. In this paper we study controllability of networks with fixed topology and weights where, however, the set of control nodes can be selected over time. Intuitively, the ability to actuate different nodes at different times allows for targeted interventions at different network locations, and can ultimately decrease the control effort to accomplish a desired task. Yet, from a practical standpoint, the implementation of time-varying control schemes requires the ability to geographically relocate actuators or the presence of actuation mechanisms at different, possibly all, network nodes, and more sophisticated control policies. To justify the additional implementation costs and control complexity, we seek to characterize network topologies and dynamics that benefit from time-varying actuator schedules, and quantify the associated control improvement. We consider time-varying control policies where a small subset of available actuators is used at any given time. While this may seem at odds with the objective of reducing the overall control effort, this scenario is relevant when, for instance, (i) actuators exhibit nonlinear dead-zone},

To comply with the network setting, our work considers perturbations with a desired sparsity structure, thus extending the classic literature on the observability radius of linear systems. The paper proposes two sets of results. First, we propose an optimization framework to determine a perturbation with smallest Frobenius norm that renders a desired mode unobservable from the existing sensor nodes. Second, we study the expected observability radius of networks with given structure and random edge weights.

We assume that agents can process only values from a finite alphabet, and we adopt the framework of finite fields, where the alphabet consists of the integers  0 , … , p − 1  , for some prime number p , and operations are performed modulo p . Thus, we define a new class of consensus dynamics, which can be exploited in certain applications such as pose estimation in capacity and memory constrained sensor networks. For consensus networks over finite fields, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the network topology and weights to ensure convergence. We show that consensus networks over finite fields converge in finite time, a feature that can be hardly achieved over the field of real numbers. For the design of finite-field consensus networks, we propose a general design method, with high computational complexity, and a network composition rule to generate large consensus networks from smaller components. Finally, we discuss the application of finite-field consensus networks to distributed averaging and pose estimation in sensor networks.},

Therefore, in this paper, we study the problem of distributed fault detection and isolation (FDI) in large networked systems with uncertain system models. The linear networked system is composed of interconnected subsystems and may be represented as a graph. The subsystems are represented by nodes, while the edges correspond to the interconnections between subsystems. Considering faults that may occur on the interconnections and subsystems, as our first contribution, we propose a distributed scheme to jointly detect and isolate faults occurring in nodes and edges of the system. As our second contribution, we analyze the behavior of the proposed scheme under model uncertainties caused by the addition or removal of edges. Additionally, we propose a novel distributed FDI scheme based on local models and measurements that is resilient to changes outside of the local subsystem and achieves FDI. Our third contribution addresses the complexity reduction of the distributed FDI method, by characterizing the minimum amount of model information and measurements needed to achieve FDI and by reducing the number of monitoring nodes. The proposed methods can be fused to design a scalable and resilient distributed FDI architecture that achieves local FDI despite unknown changes outside the local subsystem. The proposed approach is illustrated by numerical experiments on the IEEE 118-bus power network benchmark.},

abstract={Critical infrastructures such as communication networks, electrical grids, and transportation systems are highly vulnerable to natural disasters and malicious attacks. Even failures of few nodes or links may have a profound impact on large parts of the system. Traditionally, network vulnerability assessment methods separate the studies of node vulnerability and link vulnerability, and thus ignore joint node and link attack schemes that may cause grave damage to the network. To this end, we introduce a new assessment method, called ?-disruptor, that unifies both link and node vulnerability assessment. The new assessment method is formulated as an optimization problem in which we aim to identify a minimum-cost set of mixed links and nodes whose removal would severely disrupt the network connectivity. We prove the NP-completeness of the problem and propose an O(?{logn}) bicriteria approximation algorithm for the ?-disruptor problem. This new theoretical guarantee improves the best approximation results for both link and node vulnerability assessment in literature. We further enhance the proposed algorithm by embedding it into a special combination of simulated annealing and variable neighborhood search method. The results of our extensive simulation-based experiments on synthetic and real networks show the feasibility and efficiency of our proposed vulnerability assessment methods.},

abstract ={A common theme in analysis and evaluation of network-based critical infrastructure is the assessment of system vulnerability. Graph theoretic, simulation, and optimization-based techniques have played a significant role in examining potential network vulnerabilities given the insights they can provide for mitigating facility loss and prioritizing fortification efforts. Central to these approaches is the concept of facility (arc—node) importance or criticality to system survivability. Assessments of network vulnerability can dramatically differ based on how facility importance is characterized. In this review, various approaches for assessing facility importance and network vulnerability are examined. The key differences in these approaches are the ways in which a facility's role in maintaining network operability is evaluated given arc—node disruption. Comparative results suggest significant differences exist among measures of facility importance and network performance. Furthermore, the subsequent incongruities in these measures and their implications need to be clearly understood to support interdiction risk and vulnerability assessment for critical infrastructures.},

Many methods have been proposed to facilitate such analysis, providing different interpretations of infrastructure vulnerability. The primary approaches that have been employed for network vulnerability analysis can be broadly classified as scenario-specific, strategy-specific, simulation, and mathematical modeling methodologies. Research on network vulnerability assessment has traditionally focused on one of these methodologies without consideration of the others. This article highlights the important implications of methodology for both infrastructure planning and policy development. To better understand the theoretical and practical trade-offs associated with methodology selection, this article provides a review of these categories of analysis, examining benefits and shortcomings with regard to practical planning issues and policy interpretation.},

year={2009}, 
pages={1-7}, 
abstract={The studies in fault-tolerance in networks mostly focus on the connectivity of the graph as the metric of fault-tolerance. If the underlying graph is k-connected, it can tolerate up to k - 1 failures. In measuring the fault tolerance in terms of connectivity, no assumption regarding the locations of the faulty nodes are made - the failed nodes may be close to each other or far from each other. In other words, the connectivity metric has no way of capturing the notion of locality of faults. However in many networks, faults may be highly localized. This is particularly true in military networks, where an enemy bomb may inflict massive but localized damage to the network. To capture the notion of locality of faults in a network, a new metric region-based connectivity (RBC) was introduced in. It was shown that RBC can achieve the same level of fault-tolerance as the metric connectivity, with much lower networking resources. The study in was restricted to single region fault model (SRFM), where faults are confined to one region only. In this paper, we extend the notion of RBC to multiple region fault model (MRFM), where faults are no longer confined to a single region. As faults in MRFM are still confined to regions, albeit multiple of them, it is different from unconstrained fault model where no constraint on locality of faults is imposed. The MRFM leads to several new concepts, such as region-disjoint paths and region cuts. We show that the classical result, the maximum number of node-disjoint paths between a pair of nodes is equal to the minimum number of nodes whose removal disconnects the pair, is no longer valid when region-disjoint paths and region cuts are considered. We prove that the problems of finding (i) the maximum number of region-disjoint paths between a pair of nodes, and (ii) minimum number of regions whose removal disconnect a pair of nodes, are both NP-complete. We provide heuristic solution to these two problems and evaluate their efficacy by compari- ng the results with optimal solutions.},

abstract={Connectivity k(G) of a network G is traditionally considered to be the primary metric for evaluation of its fault tolerance capability. However, connectivity as a metric has several limitations - e.g., it has no mechanism to distinguish between localized and random faults. Also it does not provide any information about the network state, if number of failures exceed k(G). The network state information that might be of interest in such a scenario is the size of the largest connected component. In this paper, we address both these limitations and introduce a new metric called region-based largest component size (RBLCS), that provides the largest size of the component in which the network decomposes once all the nodes of a region fail. We study the computational complexity of finding RBLCS for a given network. In addition, we study the problem of least cost design of a network with a target value of RBLCS. We prove that the optimal design problem is NP-complete and present a heuristic to solve the problem. We evaluate our heuristic by comparing its solutions with the optimal solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that our heuristic produces near optimal solution in a fraction of time needed to find the optimal.},

Furthermore, these approaches often fail to provide performance guarantees of the proposed solutions. In this paper, we propose a vulnerability measure, pairwise connectivity, and use it to formulate network vulnerability assessment as a graph-theoretical optimization problem, referred to as -disruptor.

We prove the NP-completeness and inapproximability of this problem and propose an pseudo-approximation algorithm to computing the set of critical nodes and an pseudo-approximation algorithm for computing the set of critical edges.

abstract={Telecommunications networks, and in particular optical WDM networks, are vulnerable to large-scale failures in their physical infrastructure, resulting from physical attacks (such as an electromagnetic pulse attack) or natural disasters (such as solar flares, earthquakes, and floods). Such events happen at specific geographical locations and disrupt specific parts of the network, but their effects cannot be determined exactly in advance. Therefore, we provide a unified framework to model network vulnerability when the event has a probabilistic nature, defined by an arbitrary probability density function. Our framework captures scenarios with a number of simultaneous attacks, when network components consist of several dependent subcomponents, and in which either a 1+1 or a 1:1 protection plan is in place. We use computational geometric tools to provide efficient algorithms to identify vulnerable points within the network under various metrics. Then, we obtain numerical results for specific backbone networks, demonstrating the applicability of our algorithms to real-world scenarios. Our novel approach allows to identify locations that require additional protection efforts (e.g., equipment shielding). Overall, the paper demonstrates that using computational geometric techniques can significantly contribute to our understanding of network resilience.},

However, most of such works presume perfectly reliable nodes. Although a few studies have considered both link and node failures, none of these methods has utilized the minimal paths or cuts, which are considered as fundamental approaches in the network reliability evaluation. An efficient method for deducing the minimal cutsets of a system subject to both link and node failures from the minimal cutsets of the system, which assumes perfect node reliability, is presented. The proposed method does not require re-enumeration of minimal cutsets for the additional consideration of the node failures. For a simple extension of such a method, the proposed approach can be embedded in any exact or approximate algorithm to account for link failures as well as node failures. As a result, the application of this method would be more realistic and valuable in practice for the reliability evaluation of networks with unreliable nodes. "

abstract={The assessment of network vulnerability is of great importance in the presence of unexpected disruptive events or adversarial attacks targeting on critical network links and nodes. However, it is extremely challenging to seek and safeguard against most destructive scenarios in dynamic networks where changes to their topologies are frequently introduced. In this paper, we propose CLA and CNA algorithms, to adaptively detect critical links and nodes in a dynamic network whose removals maximally destroy the network's functions, without recomputing from scratch. The effectiveness of our solutions is validated on various types of networks with different topology structures.},

pages={143-148}, 
abstract={In an increasingly connected world, critical infrastructure systems suffer from two types of vulnerability. The first is the traditionally recognized problem of monitoring the systems for faults and failures, recognizing and analyzing data, and responding with real understanding to the problems of the system. Increasingly complex systems create the opportunity for single points of failure to cascade when inaccurate assessment of system health increases response time or leads to faulty analysis of the problems involved. A second problem involves vulnerability to cyber intrusion, in which malignant actors can mask system degradation or present false data about system status. A resilient system will protect stability, efficiency, and security. To ensure these three states, the system must react to changing conditions within the system with coordination: no one component of the system can be allowed to react to problems without real consideration of the effects of that action on other components within the system. Systems with multi-agent design typically have three layers of action, a management layer, a coordination layer, and an execution layer. A resilient multi-agent system will emphasize functions of the execution layer, which has the responsibility of initiating actions, monitoring, analyzing, and controlling its own processes, while feeding information back to the higher levels of management and coordination. The design concept of a resilient control system execution agent (ReCoSEA) grows out of these underpinnings, and through the use of computational intelligence techniques, this paper suggests an associated design methodology.},

abstract={The tradeoff between robustness and resilience is a pivotal design issue for modern industrial control systems. The trend of integrating information technologies into control system infrastructure has made resilience an important dimension of the critical infrastructure protection mission. It is desirable that systems support state awareness of threats and anomalies, and maintain acceptable levels of operation or service in the face of unanticipated or unprecedented incidents. In this paper, we propose a hybrid theoretical framework for robust and resilient control design in which the stochastic switching between structure states models unanticipated events and deterministic uncertainties in each structure represent the known range of disturbances. We propose a set of coupled optimality criteria for a holistic robust and resilient design for cyber-physical systems. We apply this method to a voltage regulator design problem for a synchronous machine with infinite bus and illustrate the solution methodology with numerical examples.},

abstract={The increasingly recognized vulnerability of industrial control systems to cyber-attacks has inspired a considerable amount of research into techniques for cyber-resilient control systems. The majority of this effort involves the application of well known information security techniques to protect system networks. These techniques are primarily concerned with the prevention of unauthorized access and the protection of data integrity. While these efforts are important to protect the control systems that operate critical infrastructure, they are never perfectly effective thus motivating a need to develop control systems that will operate successfully during a cyber attack. Little research has focused on the design of control systems with closed-loop dynamics that are resilient to cyber-attack. An understanding of the types of modifications to the system and signals that could be employed by an attacker after they have gained access to the control system and the effects of these attacks on the behavior of the control systems can guide efforts to develop attack detection and mitigation strategies. To formulate this problem, consistent mathematical definitions of concepts within resilient control need to be established to enable a mathematical analysis of the vulnerabilities and resiliencies of a particular control system design methodology and architecture. In this paper, we propose rigorous definitions for state awareness, operational normalcy, and resiliency as they relate to realtime control systems. We will also discuss some mathematical consequences that arise from the proposed definitions. The goal is to begin to develop a mathematical framework and testable conditions for resiliency that can be used to build a sound theoretical foundation for resilient control research.},

abstract={Control system networks are increasingly being connected to enterprise level networks. These connections leave critical industrial controls systems vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Most of the effort in protecting these cyber-physical systems (CPS) from attacks has been in securing the networks using information security techniques. Effort has also been applied to increasing the protection and reliability of the control system against random hardware and software failures. However, the inability of information security techniques to protect against all intrusions means that the control system must be resilient to various signal attacks for which new analysis methods need to be developed. In this paper, sensor signal attacks are analyzed for observer-based controlled systems. The threat surface for sensor signal attacks is subdivided into denial of service, finite energy, and bounded attacks. In particular, the error signals between states of attack free systems and systems subject to these attacks are quantified. Optimal sensor and actuator signal attacks for the finite and infinite horizon linear quadratic (LQ) control in terms of maximizing the corresponding cost functions are computed. The closed-loop systems under optimal signal attacks are provided. Finally, an illustrative numerical example using a power generation network is provided together with distributed LQ controllers.},

A similar approach is proposed for cyber security, where current border-protection designs have been inherited from information technology developments that lack consideration of the high-reliability, high consequence nature of industrial control systems. Instead of an independent development, however, an integrated approach is taken to develop a holistic understanding of performance. This performance takes shape inside a multi-agent design, which provides a notional context to model highly decentralized and complex industrial process control systems, the nervous system of critical infrastructure. The resulting strategy will provide a framework for researching solutions to security and unrecognized interdependency concerns with industrial control systems.},

abstract={The increasing share of distributed energy resources and renewable energy in power systems results in a highly variable and less controllable energy production. Therefore, in order to ensure stability and to reduce the infrastructure and operation cost of the power grid, flexible and controllable demand is needed. The research area of demand side management is still very much in flux and several options are being presented which can all be used to manage loads in order to achieve a flexible and more responsive demand. These different control schemes are developed with different organization of the power sector in mind and thus can differ significantly in their architecture, their integration into the various markets, their integration into distribution network operation and several other aspects. This paper proposes a classification of load control policies for demand side management in smart buildings, based on external behavior: direct, indirect, transactional and autonomous control; internal operation: decision support system scope, control strategy, failure handling and architecture. This classification assists in providing an overview of the control schemes as well as different ways of representing a building.},

The agents in each platoon are interconnected through their own communication network while only the platoon leaders are connected to global system level leader network. It is assumed that all agents are identical and are linear time invariant. For consensus control, we assume a two stage protocol: an intra-platoon protocol for platoon consensus, and an inter-platoon protocol for global system-wide consensus. The intra-platoon control is based on output information received from agents within the platoon while the inter-platoon control uses only output information of platoon leaders. We show that the system of multi-agent systems arrives at a collective consensus in the sense that each platoon arrives its own platoon consensus and at the same time all platoons collectively achieve global system-wide consensus. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the methodology.},

This paper proposes resilient control design guidelines for industrial systems that can be modeled as networked multiagent consensus systems subject to disturbances or noise. We give a general analysis of multiagent consensus networks in the presence of different disturbances from the input-to-output stability point of view. Using a nonsingular linear transformation, some necessary and sufficient results are established for disturbed multiagent consensus networks by taking advantage of the input-to-state stability theory, based on which the disturbance rejection performance is analyzed in three cases separated by the spaces of disturbances and state disagreements between agents. It is shown that the linear matrix inequality technique can be adopted to determine the optimal disturbance rejection indexes for all the three cases. In addition, two illustrative numerical examples are given to demonstrate the derived consensus results for different types of directed graphs and subject to different classes of disturbances.},

We consider a single-input single-output plant regulated by a control law based on the estimate of a Kalman filter. We allow for the presence of an attacker able to hijack and replace the control signal. The objective of the attacker is to maximize the estimation error of the Kalman filter - which in turn quantifies the degradation of the control performance - by tampering with the control input, while remaining undetected. We introduce a notion of ε-stealthiness to quantify the difficulty to detect an attack when an arbitrary detection algorithm is implemented by the controller. For a desired value of ε-stealthiness, we quantify the largest estimation error that an attacker can induce, and we analytically characterize an optimal attack strategy. Because our bounds are independent of the detection mechanism implemented by the controller, our information-theoretic analysis characterizes fundamental security limitations of stochastic cyber-physical systems.},

year={2012},

number={1},
pages={90-104},
abstract={This paper addresses the problem of ensuring trustworthy computation in a linear consensus network. A solution to this problem is relevant for several tasks in multi-agent systems including motion coordination, clock synchronization, and cooperative estimation. In a linear consensus network, we allow for the presence of misbehaving agents, whose behavior deviate from the nominal consensus evolution. We model misbehaviors as unknown and unmeasurable inputs affecting the network, and we cast the misbehavior detection and identification problem into an unknown-input system theoretic framework. We consider two extreme cases of misbehaving agents, namely faulty (non-colluding) and malicious (Byzantine) agents. First, we characterize the set of inputs that allow misbehaving agents to affect the consensus network while remaining undetected and/or unidentified from certain observing agents. Second, we provide worst-case bounds for the number of concurrent faulty or malicious agents that can be detected and identified. Precisely, the consensus network needs to be 2k+1 (resp. k+1) connected for k malicious (resp. faulty) agents to be generially detectable and identifiable by every well behaving agent. Third, we quantify the effect of undetectable inputs on the final consensus value. Fourth, we design three algorithms to detect and identify misbehaving agents. The first and the second algorithm apply fault detection techniques, and affords complete detection and identification if global knowledge of the network is available to each agent, at a high computational cost. The third algorithm is designed to exploit the presence in the network of weakly interconnected subparts, and provides local detection and identification of misbehaving agents whose behavior deviates more than a threshold, which is quantified in terms of the interconnection structure.},

We exploit two distributed methods that rely on two different sets of assumptions to achieve detection and identification. The first method takes advantage of the presence in the network of weakly interconnected subparts, it requires limited knowledge of the network model, and it affords local detection and identification of misbehaving components whose behavior deviates more than a threshold. The second method relies on the presence of a set of trustworthy leaders with better computation and communication capabilities. Only relying on a partial knowledge of the network model, the leaders cooperatively detect and identify misbehaving components.},

abstract={This paper focuses on trustworthy computation systems and proposes a novel intrusion detection scheme for linear consensus networks with misbehaving nodes. This prototypical control problem is relevant in network security applications. The objective is for each node to detect and isolate the misbehaving nodes using only the information flow adopted by standard consensus protocols. We focus on the single misbehaving node problem. Our technical approach is based on the theory of unknown input observability. First, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the misbehavior to be observable and for the identity of the faulty node to be detectable. Second, we design a distributed unknown input estimator, and we characterize its convergence rate in the "equal-neighbor" model and in the general case. Third and finally, we propose a complete detection and isolation scheme and provide some remarks on the filter convergence time. We conclude the paper with the numerical study of a consensus problem and of a robotic deployment problem.},

pages={1454-1467},
abstract={The vast majority of today's critical infrastructure is supported by numerous feedback control loops and an attack on these control loops can have disastrous consequences. This is a major concern since modern control systems are becoming large and decentralized and thus more vulnerable to attacks. This paper is concerned with the estimation and control of linear systems when some of the sensors or actuators are corrupted by an attacker. We give a new simple characterization of the maximum number of attacks that can be detected and corrected as a function of the pair (A,C) of the system and we show in particular that it is impossible to accurately reconstruct the state of a system if more than half the sensors are attacked. In addition, we show how the design of a secure local control loop can improve the resilience of the system. When the number of attacks is smaller than a threshold, we propose an efficient algorithm inspired from techniques in compressed sensing to estimate the state of the plant despite attacks. We give a theoretical characterization of the performance of this algorithm and we show on numerical simulations that the method is promising and allows to reconstruct the state accurately despite attacks. Finally, we consider the problem of designing output-feedback controllers that stabilize the system despite sensor attacks. We show that a principle of separation between estimation and control holds and that the design of resilient output feedback controllers can be reduced to the design of resilient state estimators.}}

abstract={In this paper, we study the problem of reaching a consensus among all the agents in the networked control systems (NCS) in the presence of misbehaving agents. A reputation-based resilient distributed control algorithm is first proposed for the leader-follower consensus network. The proposed algorithm embeds a resilience mechanism that includes four phases (detection, mitigation, identification, and update), into the control process in a distributed manner. At each phase, every agent only uses local and one-hop neighbors' information to identify and isolate the misbehaving agents, and even compensate their effect on the system. We then extend the proposed algorithm to the leaderless consensus network by introducing and adding two recovery schemes (rollback and excitation recovery) into the current framework to guarantee the accurate convergence of the well-behaving agents in NCS. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through case studies in multirobot formation control and wireless sensor networks.},

abstract={We develop a graph-theoretic characterization of controllability and observability of linear systems over finite fields. Specifically, we show that a linear system will be structurally controllable and observable over a finite field if the graph of the system satisfies certain properties, and the size of the field is sufficiently large. We also provide graph-theoretic upper bounds on the controllability and observability indices for structured linear systems (over arbitrary fields). We then use our analysis to design nearest-neighbor rules for multi-agent systems where the state of each agent is constrained to lie in a finite set. We view the discrete states of each agent as elements of a finite field, and employ a linear iterative strategy whereby at each time-step, each agent updates its state to be a linear combination (over the finite field) of its own state and the states of its neighbors. Using our results on structural controllability and observability, we show how a set of leader agents can use this strategy to place all agents into any desired state (within the finite set), and how a set of sink agents can recover the set of initial values held by all of the agents.},

abstract = "Robustness in complex networks is an ongoing research effort that seeks to improve the connectivity of networks against attacks and failures. Among other measures, algebraic connectivity has been used to characterize processes such as damped oscillation of liquids in connected pipes. Similar characterizations include the number of edges necessary to disconnect a network: the larger the algebraic connectivity, the larger the number of edges required to disconnect a network and hence, the more robust a network. In this paper, we answer the question, âWhich edge can we rewire to have the largest increase in algebraic connectivity?â. Furthermore, we extend the rewiring of a single edge to rewiring multiple edges to realize the maximal increase in algebraic connectivity. The answer to this question above can provide insights to decision makers within various domains such as communication and transportation networks, who seek an efficient solution to optimize the connectivity and thus increase the robustness of their networks. Most importantly, our analytical and numerical results not only provide insights to the number of edges to rewire, but also the location in the network where these edges would effectuate the maximal increase in algebraic connectivity and therefore, enable a maximal increase in robustness.

abstract={Wireless communication systems are susceptible to jamming attacks, and a large body of research has investigated jamming and anti-jamming strategies for single communication links. However, attacking single links may not be sufficient to disrupt communications in a network, which may route traffic around jammed links. To date, there has been little research on jamming to disrupt an entire network. In this paper, we consider the problem of determining how to efficiently place jammers to minimize the number of jammers needed to disrupt a network by partitioning it into a specified number of disconnected subnetworks, each of which is limited in size. We formulate this problem as an optimal clustering problem on a graph and show that the clustering problem can be solved exactly as a binary integer linear program (ILP). Since the complexity of the ILP increases rapidly with the size of the network, we also solve the ILP via harmony search, a meta-heuristic algorithm. Harmony search offers the ability to tradeoff between complexity and performance. In the scenarios where comparison between the two algorithms is feasible, the harmony search provides close-to-optimal performance with a much lower time complexity.},

In our study, anti-jamming mobility control is investigated in the context of the single and multiple commodity flow problems, in the presence of intelligent mobile jammers which can respond to the evasion of legitimate nodes as well. Based on spectral graph theory, two new spectral quantities, single- and multi-weighted Cheeger constants and corresponding eigenvalue variants, are constructed to direct motions of the defender and the attacker in this dynamic adaptive competition. Both analytical and simulation results are presented to justify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Furthermore, the proposed scheme can also be applied in cognitive radio networks to reconfigure the secondary users in the presence of mobile primary users.},

abstract={We consider distributed consensus and vehicular formation control problems. Specifically we address the question of whether local feedback is sufficient to maintain coherence in large-scale networks subject to stochastic disturbances. We define macroscopic performance measures which are global quantities that capture the notion of coherence; a notion of global order that quantifies how closely the formation resembles a solid object. We consider how these measures scale asymptotically with network size in the topologies of regular lattices in 1, 2, and higher dimensions, with vehicular platoons corresponding to the 1-D case. A common phenomenon appears where a higher spatial dimension implies a more favorable scaling of coherence measures, with a dimensions of 3 being necessary to achieve coherence in consensus and vehicular formations under certain conditions. In particular, we show that it is impossible to have large coherent 1-D vehicular platoons with only local feedback. We analyze these effects in terms of the underlying energetic modes of motion, showing that they take the form of large temporal and spatial scales resulting in an accordion-like motion of formations. A conclusion can be drawn that in low spatial dimensions, local feedback is unable to regulate large-scale disturbances, but it can in higher spatial dimensions. This phenomenon is distinct from, and unrelated to string instability issues which are commonly encountered in control problems for automated highways.},

abstract={This paper considers control and estimation problems where the sensor signals and the actuator signals are transmitted to various subsystems over a network. In contrast to traditional control and estimation problems, here the observation and control packets may be lost or delayed. The unreliability of the underlying communication network is modeled stochastically by assigning probabilities to the successful transmission of packets. This requires a novel theory which generalizes classical control/estimation paradigms. The paper offers the foundations of such a novel theory. The central contribution is to characterize the impact of the network reliability on the performance of the feedback loop. Specifically, it is shown that for network protocols where successful transmissions of packets is acknowledged at the receiver (e.g., TCP-like protocols), there exists a critical threshold of network reliability (i.e., critical probabilities for the successful delivery of packets), below which the optimal controller fails to stabilize the system. Further, for these protocols, the separation principle holds and the optimal LQG controller is a linear function of the estimated state. In stark contrast, it is shown that when there is no acknowledgment of successful delivery of control packets (e.g., UDP-like protocols), the LQG optimal controller is in general nonlinear. Consequently, the separation principle does not hold in this circumstance},

abstract={This paper concerns the study of observability in consensus networks modeled with strongly regular graphs or distance regular graphs. We first give a Kalman-like simple algebraic criterion for observability in distance regular graphs. This criterion consists in evaluating the rank of a matrix built with the components of the Bose-Mesner algebra associated with the considered graph. Then, we define some bipartite graphs that capture the observability properties of the graph to be studied. In particular, we show that necessary and sufficient observability conditions are given by the nullity of the so-called local bipartite observability graph (respectively, the local unfolded bipartite observability graph) for strongly regular graphs (respectively, the distance regular graphs). When the nullity cannot be derived directly from the structure of these bipartite graphs, the rank of the associated bi-adjacency matrix enables evaluating observability. Eventually, as a byproduct of the main results, we show that nonobservability can be stated just by comparing the valency of the graph to be studied with a bound computed from the number of vertices of the graph and its diameter. Similarly, nonobservability can also be stated by evaluating the size of the maximum matching in the aforementioned bipartite graphs.},

year={2011}, 
pages={83-88}, 
abstract={The predominance of recent self-healing power system research has been directed towards centralized command and control functions. In this paper, a decentralized multi-agent control method for distributed microgrids is introduced. Given the complexity of a large power system spanning hundreds of miles and comprised of numerous microgrids, it is potentially unrealistic to expect that centralizing total system control functions is feasible. Therefore, the authors are particularly interested in dispersing decision-making by utilizing smart microgrid control agents that cooperate during normal and emergency situations. The combination of microgrids and agent-based control can improve power system resiliency. The method described herein lays the groundwork for a comprehensive microgrid control architecture that strikes a balance between the multiple intra-microgrid objectives defined by local operator and the situational demands of the microgrid collective as part of the power system. In this way, both self-interest and cooperation can arise, allowing microgrid agents to successfully transition from normal operations to an emergency condition and back again when conditions have resolved, independent of a central supervisor. The decentralized multi-agent methods for microgrids explored in this paper help to support what may be an enabling technology of future smart grids.},

abstract = "Abstract The structural robustness of the infrastructure of various real-life systems, which can be represented by networks, is of great importance. Thus we have proposed a tabu search algorithm to optimize the structural robustness of a given network by rewiring the links and fixing the node degrees. The objective of our algorithm is to maximize a new structural robustness measure, natural connectivity, which provides a sensitive and reliable measure of the structural robustness of complex networks and has lower computation complexity. We initially applied this method to several networks with different degree distributions for contrast analysis and investigated the basic properties of the optimal network. We discovered that the optimal network based on the power-law degree distribution exhibits a roughly “eggplant-like” topology, where there is a cluster of high-degree nodes at the head and other low-degree nodes scattered across the body of “eggplant”. Additionally, the cost to rewire links in practical applications is considered; therefore, we optimized this method by employing the assortative rewiring strategy and validated its efficiency. "

abstract={In this paper, the controllability problem for multi-agent systems is investigated. In particular, the case of a single leader under a fixed topology is considered. In contrast to the existing literature on this topic, we assume that the graph is weighted and we may freely assign the weights. Under this setup, the system is controllable if one may find a set of weights so as to satisfy the classical controllability rank condition. It turns out that this controllability notation purely depends on the topology of the communication scheme, and the multi-agent system is controllable if and only if the graph is connected. Moreover, some simulation results and numerical examples are presented to illustrate the approach.},

The property of structural controllability is reduced to a property of the graph of the pair ( A,b ). To do this, the basic concept of a "cactus" and the related concept of a "precactus" are introduced. The main result of this paper states that the pair ( A,b ) is structurally controllable if an only if the graph of ( A,b ) is "spanned by a cactus."

We determine that there is a polynomial number of non-trivial positions for such a figure that need to be considered and, subsequently, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm for the problem. Simulations on realistic networks illustrate that different figures with equal area result in different critical regions in a network.},

We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We applied this approach to segmenting static images, as well as motion sequences, and found the results to be very encouraging},

An overview of basic concepts of information consensus in networks and methods of convergence and performance analysis for the algorithms are provided. Our analysis framework is based on tools from matrix theory, algebraic graph theory, and control theory. We discuss the connections between consensus problems in networked dynamic systems and diverse applications including synchronization of coupled oscillators, flocking, formation control, fast consensus in small-world networks, Markov processes and gossip-based algorithms, load balancing in networks, rendezvous in space, distributed sensor fusion in sensor networks, and belief propagation. We establish direct connections between spectral and structural properties of complex networks and the speed of information diffusion of consensus algorithms. A brief introduction is provided on networked systems with nonlocal information flow that are considerably faster than distributed systems with lattice-type nearest neighbor interactions. Simulation results are presented that demonstrate the role of small-world effects on the speed of consensus algorithms and cooperative control of multivehicle formations},

abstract={In this paper, we discuss consensus problems for networks of dynamic agents with fixed and switching topologies. We analyze three cases: 1) directed networks with fixed topology; 2) directed networks with switching topology; and 3) undirected networks with communication time-delays and fixed topology. We introduce two consensus protocols for networks with and without time-delays and provide a convergence analysis in all three cases. We establish a direct connection between the algebraic connectivity (or Fiedler eigenvalue) of the network and the performance (or negotiation speed) of a linear consensus protocol. This required the generalization of the notion of algebraic connectivity of undirected graphs to digraphs. It turns out that balanced digraphs play a key role in addressing average-consensus problems. We introduce disagreement functions for convergence analysis of consensus protocols. A disagreement function is a Lyapunov function for the disagreement network dynamics. We proposed a simple disagreement function that is a common Lyapunov function for the disagreement dynamics of a directed network with switching topology. A distinctive feature of this work is to address consensus problems for networks with directed information flow. We provide analytical tools that rely on algebraic graph theory, matrix theory, and control theory. Simulations are provided that demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.},

A decentralized approach may be the ideal way to health monitor large-scale systems for faults, since it decomposes the problem down into (potentially smaller) “local” problems and then blends the “local” results into a “global” result that describes the health of the entire systems. The benefits of such an approach include added fault tolerance and easy scalability. An example given at the end of the paper demonstrates the use of this filter for a platoon of cars proposed for advanced vehicle control systems},

In this paper we address two aspects of this problem which allow direct application of numerical analysis work. Essentially, there are two ideas which are discussed 1) If the closed loop eigenvalues are separated, one should avoid a closed loop system whose eigenvector matrix is nearly singular. 2) If there are to be repeated or clustered eigenvalues, one should not deal directly with the eigenvectors of the cluster; instead one should use an orthogonal basis which approximates the corresponding closed loop (A+BF) invariant subspace.},

abstract={Given a network of interconnected nodes, each with its own value (such as a measurement, position, vote, or other data), we develop a distributed strategy that enables some or all of the nodes to calculate any arbitrary function of the node values, despite the actions of malicious nodes in the network. Our scheme assumes a broadcast model of communication (where all nodes transmit the same value to all of their neighbors) and utilizes a linear iteration where, at each time-step, each node updates its value to be a weighted average of its own previous value and those of its neighbors. We consider a node to be malicious or faulty if, instead of following the predefined linear strategy, it updates its value arbitrarily at each time-step (perhaps conspiring with other malicious nodes in the process). We show that the topology of the network completely characterizes the resilience of linear iterative strategies to this kind of malicious behavior. First, when the network contains 2f or fewer vertex-disjoint paths from some node xj to another node xi , we provide an explicit strategy for f malicious nodes to follow in order to prevent node xi from receiving any information about xj's value. Next, if node xi has at least 2f+1 vertex-disjoint paths from every other (non-neighboring) node, we show that xi is guaranteed to be able to calculate any arbitrary function of all node values when the number of malicious nodes is f or less. Furthermore, we show that this function can be calculated after running the linear iteration for a finite number of time-steps (upper bounded by the number of nodes in the network) with almost any set of weights (i.e., for all weights except for a set of measure zero).},

abstract={We consider the problem of distributed function calculation in the presence of faulty or malicious agents. In particular, we consider a setup where each node has an initial value and the goal is for (a subset of) the nodes to calculate a function of these values in a distributed manner. We focus on linear iterative strategies for function calculation, where each node updates its value at each time-step to be a weighted average of its own previous value and those of its neighbors; after a sufficiently large number of time-steps, each node is expected to have enough information to calculate the desired function of the initial node values. We study the susceptibility of such strategies to misbehavior by some nodes in the network; specifically, we consider a node to be malicious if it updates its value arbitrarily at each time-step, instead of following the predefined linear iterative strategy. If the connectivity of the network topology is 2f or less, we show that it is possible for a set of f malicious nodes to conspire in a way that makes it impossible for a subset of the other nodes in the network to correctly calculate an arbitrary function of all node values. Our analysis is constructive, in that it provides a specific scheme for the malicious nodes to follow in order to obfuscate the network in this fashion.},

	Abstract = {Two points in a polygon are called visible if the straight line segment between them lies entirely inside the polygon. The art gallery problemfor a polygon P is to find a minimum set of points G in P such that every point of P is visible fiom some point of G. This problem has been shown to be NP-hard by Lee and Lin. However, Chvatal showed that the number of points of G will never exceed [n/3] for a simple polygon of n sides. This latter result is referred to as the art gallery theorem. Many variations on the art gallery problem have been studied, and work in this area has accelerated after the publication of the monograph of 0 'Rourke, which deals exclusively with this topic.
This paper provides an introduction to art gallery theorems, and surveys the recent results of thefield. The emphasis is on the results rather than the techniques. Inaddition, this paper examines several new problems that have the same geometric flavor as art gallery problems.},
	Annote = {This is a very insightful but old paper that surveys results pertaining to the museum guard problem (art gallery problem).  Section I is excellent.  It reviews the definition of a polygon and its relation to planar graphs and states the art gallery problem with some precision.  The paper also discusses triangulation and outerplanar graphs.  Overall, a decent paper. },

year={2015},
volume={103},
number={9},
pages={1449-1477},
abstract={In various disciplines, information about the same phenomenon can be acquired from different types of detectors, at different conditions, in multiple experiments or subjects, among others. We use the term “modality” for each such acquisition framework. Due to the rich characteristics of natural phenomena, it is rare that a single modality provides complete knowledge of the phenomenon of interest. The increasing availability of several modalities reporting on the same system introduces new degrees of freedom, which raise questions beyond those related to exploiting each modality separately. As we argue, many of these questions, or “challenges,” are common to multiple domains. This paper deals with two key issues: “why we need data fusion” and “how we perform it.” The first issue is motivated by numerous examples in science and technology, followed by a mathematical framework that showcases some of the benefits that data fusion provides. In order to address the second issue, “diversity” is introduced as a key concept, and a number of data-driven solutions based on matrix and tensor decompositions are discussed, emphasizing how they account for diversity across the data sets. The aim of this paper is to provide the reader, regardless of his or her community of origin, with a taste of the vastness of the field, the prospects, and the opportunities that it holds.},
